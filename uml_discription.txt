The model in Django represet the classes. They define the structure of the application. Each model corresponds to a
database table and includes fields (attributes) and methods (functions).
Relationship lines that connect models indicate one-to-many or many-to-many.
Like the ForeinKey relationship would be shown with  a line from the child model to the parent model,
shown with multiplicity(1,*,)
